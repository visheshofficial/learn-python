##Key points: 

### Variables and simple data types
- variable naming conventions
- Variables Are Labels
  - a variable references a certain value
  
-  f-strings
    - F-strings were first introduced in Python 3.6. If you’re using Python 3.5 or earlier, you’ll need to use the format() method rather than this f syntax.
    
- Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines
- Stripping Whitespace
- Numbers
- Floats
- Number and Floats
   - When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number, you’ll always get a float
   - if you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you’ll get a floa

- Underscores in Numbers : 
   - 14_000_000_000
   - 30 == 3_0 
- Multiple Assignment:
  -  x, y, z = 0, 0, 0
  
- Constants
  - MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
  -  Python doesn’t have built-in constant types
